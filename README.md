# Motor-Drive-Defect-Prediction

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies default conditions in motor drives based on sensor data. By analyzing the behavior of over 45 electrical sensor parameters, various machine learning classifiers were trained, tuned, and evaluated to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the sensor data for model training.
- Modeling: Implementing and training multiple classifier models, including:
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Naive Bayes
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the hyperparameters of each model to enhance performance.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and accuracy metrics.
- Best Model: The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.86%.
